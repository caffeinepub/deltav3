Backend remains a single empty Motoko actor. However, the diff does not provide evidence that the uploaded logo image file itself is included as a frontend static asset, and the search results rendering/link clickability is truncated so cannot be fully verified from the provided summary. Several unrequested features/scaffolding (Internet Identity + actor/react-query hooks, caffeine.ai footer credit) were added.",
